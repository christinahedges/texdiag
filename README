texdiag
=======

texdiag is a python script to produce diagnostics of long tex files, such as academic papers and theses. This includes a word count both overall and broken down by section, a list of all included figures and tex files and a visual representation of the section lengths using a Gantt chart. This is designed to make it easier to find in long tex documents, particularly those that include many different subdocuments, where more text could be added or could be cut.

To use this script download texdiag.py and run either in the python terminal or from the shell using 

    python -c "import texdiag as t;t.diagnose('./examples/example.tex')"
